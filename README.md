## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

I have learnt a lot:

- For the first time, I used tailwind css for a project
- I learnt how to install and runn tailwind
- I learnt how to configure tailwind
- I got great tailwind practice 
- I understood the concept of linear gradients while finding out how to achieve the linear gradient

### Continued development

This code can be made more responsive. It currently looks terrible just at the media query (around 770px).
Sizes can be made on percentage or view widths.
